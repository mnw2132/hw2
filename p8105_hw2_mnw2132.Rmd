```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem 1
*Bring data in and begin cleaning*
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
transit_data = read_csv(file = "/Users/nickywilliams/Desktop/hw2/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")%>%
  janitor::clean_names()
  na=c(".","NA","")
```

*read data* 
```{r}
transit_data
names(transit_data)
```

*clean data*


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Problem 2

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Problem 3
